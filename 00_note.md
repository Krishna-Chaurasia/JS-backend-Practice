# npm init: will initialize node package manager file named package.json

```

0)  create a folder public >> inside this create another folder temp >> currently both folders do 
    not have any files.
1)  Git track of files; not empty folders. 
1.1) so if any empty folder is present >> git status >> shows nothing to commit because git do not
     tracks of empty folders. >> hence we can't push empty folders

2) public folder >> temp folder >> create a file named ".gitkeep"
2.1) now if we run git status >> shows untracked files .. public/
2.1) .gitkeep file is created(or any file can be) because we need to push those empty folders
    i.e public/temp
